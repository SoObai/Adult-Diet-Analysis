## 📝 Abstract
This Tableau dashboard project analyzes COVID-19-era public health trends across U.S. states, using CDC's Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity (NPAO) dataset. The dashboard explores how state-level indicators changed across years, providing stakeholders a visual summary to identify patterns, hotspots, and anomalies in population health during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Visualize disparities in obesity and health behaviors across U.S. states.
- Identify time-based patterns and trends in physical activity and nutrition.
- Enable dynamic exploration of CDC health indicators using Tableau.
- Present findings in an interactive and intuitive dashboard format.
